# 2015Robot
The code for the 2015 robot.


# Notes
This project was built using the Robot Builder application. I used it to simplify getting things started up. There are a couple of things to note about this:

1. The Robot Builder uses comments marked as "Begin Autogenerated Code" and "End Autogenerated Code" in order to know where to place things. For the time being, leave this in place. We will remove them later, but they should be kept for now in case we need to keep using the Robot Builder.
2. Any comments or code you put between the "Begin" and "End" comments will be removed if we run the Robot Builder again. Just be aware of this.
3. The naming convention that the Robot Builder uses is as follows: <Subsystem name><Component name>. For example, "driveTrainLeftEncoder."
